# Self Driving Car
Is a pet project about a car that autonomously navigates a virtual world.

This project follows the video series of [Radu Mariescu-Istodor](https://radufromfinland.com) about a [self-driving car](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0Tybl0UNfYoJE7ZwsBQoDIG4YN9ptyY).

## Run the project
